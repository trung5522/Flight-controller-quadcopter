# Flight-controller-quadcopter
This is my graduation thesis project, fully developed by myself. The project was evaluated with a score of 8.9/10, highlighting my independent research and implementation skills.

Research and calculate the dynamics for a quadcopter. 

2-layer PCB for flight control circuits with the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroler, designed using Altium. 

Research optimal flight algorithms and program them in C language for ARM (STM32F405). 

Utilize filters to optimize sensor reading values (Kalman, Complementary)

Perform test flights and adjust PID values to optimize the quadcopter's performance. 

Use QT to create a GUI for receiving feedback values from the quadcopter (angle, altitude, GPS).

A drone capable of position hold without GPS and altitude hold without input from the controller
